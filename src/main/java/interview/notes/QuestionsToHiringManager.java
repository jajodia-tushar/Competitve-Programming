    1. What are the main qualities you expect from your future employees ?

    3. Can you tell me a bit more about the team I might work with if I join the Company ?

    5. Could you tell me little bit more about the process setup within the team ?
    6. How would you define your management styles ?
    7. What do you think will count as being Successful in this Position ?

    8. With my current employer there is company wide monthly award and recognition which I believe has really
        help employees contribute to things that are not in their plate really and also to build the truth among the
        employees that their works are being recognized and they are not being left out.
        And I think in the long run this one thing plays a significant role making employees feel homely and safe.
        What small things that you do to keep employees motivated and keep them building trust.


    I have never in my entire life seen things moving correctly when you pressure it. I believe good things will take time.
    A quote that I often keep myself reminding, If you fire the tail of a Donkey it may sometime beat the Horses as well.
    But that is not the way to build great things, things that last. I believe trust plays a major role in shaping the product
    we are building.

    I want to share with you one instance or a incident that my friend has shared with me.
    He was new in his organization, when he first got his work assigned and he started coding he found out that there were a lot
    of small things that were already in the code but could have been improved so he along with his task started refactoring these
    small stuffs as well.
    Now Because of this the delivery was hampered and the manager was really very upset and asked him to speed up his deliveries
    and do what ever it takes to deliver things on time.
    Now he had no options than to leave the things that he could have improved.
    He then told me later on, the same small improvement made a huge issue on production and the entire application was stopped.
    and it took significant amount of time in debugging and testing to figure out the original issue.
    So How do you handle these things.

    Is this a new Position or someone left ?
